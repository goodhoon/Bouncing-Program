The applicationis a simple bouncing program. Different shapes move around in various paths.
To start the program, please click the 'start' butoon on the panel.

<Shape Creation>
The user can create a new shape by clicking anywhere within the panel area of the program. The properties of the newly created shape are based on the current values saved in the appropriate UI fields
(e.g. height, width border colour, fill colour and the moving path).

<Selecting/deselecting shapes>
A user can select a shape by clicking anywhere on the shape.
If a shape is selected, all its handles are shown.
The user can change the path types/widths/heights/border colours/fill colours for all selected shapes
by changing the current values with the help of the tools provided at the top of the application interface.
(But the shape type canâ€™t be modified once a shape has been created.)
Clicking on a selected shape will deselect it
